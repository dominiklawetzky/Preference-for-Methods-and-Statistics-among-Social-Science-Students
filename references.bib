	abstract = {Typical assessments of personality traits collapse behaviors, thoughts, and feelings into a single measure without distinguishing between these different manifestations. To address this lack of specification, the current study develops and validates a measure that assesses a number of broad behaviors associated with the personality trait of conscientiousness (the Behavioral Indicators of Conscientiousness; BIC). Findings suggest that the lower-order structure of conscientious behaviors is mostly similar to the lower-order structure in extant trait measures. Furthermore, a daily diary method was used to validate the BIC against frequency counts of conscientious behavior. Overall, the results identify specific behaviors that conscientious individuals tend to perform and highlight possible advantages of this approach over broad trait assessment.},

	abstract = {The doctrine of attitudes, which has almost completely captured and refashioned the science of social psychology, requires clarification. Historical considerations make it necessary to include a wide range of subjective determining tendencies among attitudes; yet it is possible and desirable to distinguish between attitudes and many correlative forms of readiness-for-response. Attitudes may be –idriving–n or –idirective, specific–n or –igeneral, common–n or –iindividual–n. They characteristically have a material or conceptual object of reference, and are "pointed" in some direction with respect to this object. If so generalized that the object and the direction are not identifiable, they merge into the "traits" of personality. Common attitudes can be roughly classified and measured, and when abstracted from the personalities which contain them they constitute the "socius," which is that portion of the unique personality of special interest to social science. Though attitudes are inferred rather than observed, they must be admitted as real and substantial ingredients in human nature, for without them it is impossible to account satisfactorily either for the consistency of any individual's behavior or for the stability of any society.

However, further analyses showed that only for individuals high in exchange orientation was equity related to marital satisfaction and that individuals low in exchange orientation were, overall, more satisfied with their relationship. Women were more deprived and less satisfied, especially when they were high in exchange orientation. The results are related to the controversy surrounding the application of equity theory to close relationships.

All predictions were supported, although the pattern of effects differed for positive and negative events.

Ss listed the factors that they thought influenced their own chances of experiencing 8 future events. When such lists were read by a 2nd group of Ss, the amount of unrealistic optimism shown by this 2nd group for the same 8 events decreased significantly, although it was not eliminated.

The aim of this chapter is to present an outline of a theory of intergroup conflict and some preliminary data relating to the theory. It begins with a discussion of alternative approaches to intergroup conflict with special attention to the "realistic group conflict theory" (RCT). RCT's relative neglect of the processes underlying the development and maintenance of group identity and the possibly autonomous effects upon the in-group and intergroup behavior is responsible for some inconsistencies between the empirical data and the theory in its "classical" form. In this sense, the theoretical orientation to be outlined in this chapter is intended not to replace RCT, but to supplement it in some respects that seem essential for an adequate social psychology of intergroup conflict--particularly as the understanding of the psychological aspects of social change cannot be achieved without an appropriate analysis of the social psychology of social conflict. The authors argue that people derive a sense of self-worth and social belongingness from their memberships in groups, and so they are motivated to draw favorable comparisons between their own group and other groups.

One domain of the self (actual; ideal; ought) and one standpoint on the self (own; significant other) constitute each type of self-state representation. It is proposed that different types of self-discrepancies represent different types of negative psychological situations that are associated with different kinds of discomfort. Discrepancies between the actual/own self-state (i.e., the self-concept) and ideal self-states (i.e., representations of an individual's beliefs about his or her own or a significant other's hopes, wishes, or aspirations for the individual) signify the absence of positive outcomes, which is associated with dejection-related emotions (e.g., disappointment, dissatisfaction, sadness). In contrast, discrepancies between the actual/own self-state and ought self-states (i.e., representations of an individual's beliefs about his or her own or a significant other's beliefs about the individual's duties, responsibilities, or obligations) signify the presence of negative outcomes, which is associated with agitation-related emotions (e.g., fear, threat, restlessness). Differences in both the relative magnitude and the accessibility of individuals' available types of self-discrepancies are predicted to be related to differences in the kinds of discomfort people are likely to experience. Correlational and experimental evidence supports the predictions of the model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Exp I, with 90 undergraduates, showed that consensus information was seen as more important for interpreting occurrences, whereas distinctiveness information was perceived as more important for interpreting actions. Exp II, with 144 Ss, showed that attributed causes for a given behavior affected inferences about generalizability of the behavior over persons (consensus), objects (distinctiveness), and circumstances (consistency). The effect of attribution on consensus inferences was more emphasized for occurrences than for actions; the effect of attribution on inferences of distinctiveness was somewhat more pronounced for actions, but this effect was not significant; the effect of attribution on inferences of consistency was more pronounced for occurrences than for actions. An unexpected finding was that, in general, Ss viewed actions as more generalizable (behaviors performed by other people, with other objects, and under other circumstances) than occurrences.

	isbn = {0-387-91389-0 (Hardcover)},
	abstract = {Social identity theory is a major social psychological theory of intergroup relations and group processes. Formulated in the early 1970s by the late Henri Tajfel, its central tenet is that group behavior arises from a shared sense of social category membership, an insight which has led to exciting theoretical advances in social psychology.  This book gives a critical and constructive description of many of the most important developments by major contemporary social identity researchers in Europe, Austrailia and North America. The first section focuses on cognitive and motivational processes in group behavior; the second on the relationship between identification and regulation of motivational behavior within the group; and the third on relationships between groups with social structure. The book, which also provides and extensive integrated reference list, will be of interest to students, rsearchers and teachers of social psychology.
